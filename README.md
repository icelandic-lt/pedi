# Pedi - A Pronunciation Dictionary Editor

Pedi is a web application to read, edit and export pronunciation dictionaries. 

## Features of the Prototype

### Import SAMPA list

A SAMPA list can be imported into the web application. You can find a sample list inside the sample-data/ sub directory.

### Import CSV text files as pronunciation dictionaries

A dictionary is made up of CSV formatted text and has the following format:

|  **WORD** | **SAMPA PRONUNCIATION**  | **POS** | **PRON_VARIANT** | **IS_COMPOUND** | **COMPOUND_ATTR** | **HAS_PREFIX** | **LANG** | **IS_VALIDATED** | **COMMENT** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hvass | x a s | lo | south_clear | false | none| false | IS | false |
| einhverri | ei N k_h v E r I | fn | northeast_clear | false | none | false | IS | false | Vantar entry (south) |
| þurftu | T Y r_0 t Y | so | all | false | none | false | IS | false |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

When importing, the name of the dictionary is set by the user. The import functionality saves the dictionary into an internal database table.


### Show overview of dictionaries

Imported dictionaries are shown in a list view with number of entries and options to delete or export them as CSV lists.

### Show and edit contents of a dictionary

An imported dictionary is organized as list of entries:
- Word
- SAMPA pronunciation
- Editing status
- Comment
- Language
- POS tag
- Component part
- Dialect
- boolean if word is a compound
- boolean if word starts with a prefix

Entries are shown paginated if they don't fit on a page.

#### Incorrect phonetic transcriptions

If a transcription of an entry is incorrect, there appears a colored yellow marking of the incorrect transcription. A violation of the following rules are therefore marked as incorrect:

- All SAMPA pronunciation symbols have to be separated by a space
- All symbols have to be part of the well defined SAMPA symbol set

#### Filters

Entries can be filtered via the following criteria:

- Word as Regular Expression
- SAMPA transcription as Regular Expression
- Comment as Regular Expression
- Warnings

#### Editing

It is possible to edit the following attributes of a dictionary entry:

- Word
- SAMPA pronunciation
- Editing status
- Comment
- Language
- POS tag
- Component part
- Dialect
- boolean if word is a compound
- boolean if word starts with a prefix

### Export SAMPA  dictionaries as CSV text files

Every dictionary can be exported to a local file on disk with the same CSV format as described in the import section. If multiple dictionaries are selected, all of these will be exported into one CSV file.

### User Authentication

There is a basic user authentication to access the web application. All users share the same rights. Default user and password is admin@example.com/admin_password.

### I8N

The application is available in Icelandic and English. Icelandic is the default language. You can choose either language from a drop-down list at the top right. 

## Getting started

First make sure to have Ruby installed. Afterwards, run `bundle` in the root directory. Then follow these steps:

```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
rails server
````
The seed data should be enough to give you an idea how this application works.

For subsequents updates of this application, you just need to use these commands:

```bash
rails db:migrate
rails server
```

If you see any problems related to yarn, try to call the following command in a terminal:

```
yarn install --check-files
```

After finishing the above steps, you should be able to access the web application on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
